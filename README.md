NapalmFramework
===============

NapalmFramework is a very simple PHP framework to speed up development of PHP applications. Its not trying to compete with big frameworks like CakePHP or Codeigniter, it only manages user authentication and basic application structure. Developer may also opt in to use the NapalmFrameworks database connection.

This is mostly designed for my own personal projects, so there aren't any documentations.

##Features

* User authentication management
* Basic structure for application (priv/ publ/)
* commandline client to create/delete users and data
* Fast and secure
* Easy to learn, it only does the authentication for you!
